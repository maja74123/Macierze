# Operations with matrices

## Project description

This project aims to demonstrate how to perform basic matrix operations in Python without using the NumPy library. The repository includes code that implements the Matrix class and enables operations such as addition, multiplication, determinant, transpose, inverse, and trace calculation. You can display the entire matrix or its specific row/column/element.

#### The project was prepared as a part of the subject  *Algorytmy i programowanie* (UAM Pozna≈Ñ, June 2023).
